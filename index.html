<p>JavaScript is a small and lightweight language.Inside a host environment,Javascript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmic control over them.</p>
<p>It contains a core set of language elements such as operators and statements.Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects;for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guide assumes you have the following basic background</p>
<ul>
  <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
  <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
  <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<header>JavaScript and Java</header>
  <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
<header>Hello world</header>
  <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
  <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
greetMe("World");</code>
<p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
<header>Variables</header>

<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
<header>Declaring variables</header>
  <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
  <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
  <code>var x = 42.</code>
  <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
  <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
  <code>x = 42.</code>
  <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
  <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
  <code>let y = 13.</code>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>Constants</header>
              <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
              <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
              <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.</p>
              <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
              <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
              <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
//statements }</code>
<p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>
<code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
"otherValue";</code>
